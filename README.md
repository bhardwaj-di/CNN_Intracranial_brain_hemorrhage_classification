# CNN Intracranial brain hemorrhage classification <br/>
### Problem Statement <br/>
The detection and classification of cerebral hemorrhages is the challenge that we focused
on. For patients with brain hemorrhages to have a better chance of surviving, an
immediate diagnosis of the kind of hemorrhage and subsequent treatment are required. It
has been demonstrated that machine learning models are quite effective in helping
doctors classify cerebral hemorrhages using multi-label 6-class classification (normal,
epidural, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid, and subdural). We use the
assessment measures for precision, recall, and f1 to analyze our findings. <br/><br/>

### Conclusion <br/>
To achieve good classification performance hemorrhages, we provide a number of deep
learning models, including artificial neural networks and convolutional neural network
models. The CNN 2 layer had the greatest results, with an accuracy of 0.59. We think this
algorithm worked better because we could use transfer learning, and since it had more
complexity, it helped to learn our training set.
Lastly, and perhaps most crucially from an objective standpoint, we intend to train the
model using the entire dataset rather than just the 2500 images that we were able to use
for our training. We anticipate that by doing this, overfitting will be addressed, and we
will be able to attain considerably higher precision, recall, and accuracy.
